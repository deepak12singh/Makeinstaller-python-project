## **Installation**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, download the project files to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepak12singh/Makeinstaller-python-project
cd Makeinstaller-python-project
```

### **Step 2: Run the Installer**

Navigate to the project directory and execute the installer:

```bash
installer.bat
```

This will copy the necessary files, configure a virtual environment, and make the project globally accessible.

### **Step 3: Confirm the Installation**

After running the installer, verify the process by checking the output folder. You should see the organized project structure and confirmation messages.  

Example of the structure:

### **Step 4: Delete Clone Repository (Optional)**

Once the installation is complete, you can delete the cloned repository files from your system if you no longer need them. The project will remain accessible globally.

---

## **Usage**

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**  
   Place the Python script or project folder you want to make globally accessible into the designated directory.

2. **Run the Command:**  
   Execute the following command to start the installation process:

   ```bash
   MakeInstaller run here
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Output Folder:**  
   After a successful setup, navigate to the automatically created `OUTPUT` folder:  
   ```bash
   cd OUTPUT
   ```

4. **Install Your Project:**  
   Run the `installer.bat` file in the output folder:  
   ```bash
   installer.bat
   ```

5. **Test the Installation:**  
   Open a new command prompt and call your project name globally. For example, if your project is named `Project_Name`:  
   ```bash
   Project_Name
   ```

---

## **How It Works**

1. **File Organization:**  
   - The user places their Python script or project into the designated input folder.  

2. **Environment Setup:**  
   - A virtual environment is created to isolate dependencies.

3. **Global Accessibility:**  
   - The project is configured to be accessible globally via the command line.

4. **Help Documentation:**  
   - A `--help` option is generated to guide users.

---

## **Use Cases**

- **Automation Tools:** Share Python utilities that automate repetitive tasks.  
- **Team Collaboration:** Distribute Python tools across a development team.  
- **Project Distribution:** Simplify the deployment process for your Python projects.  
- **Education:** Package educational Python scripts for students or peers.
